# Human-Fall-Detection-Using-mpu6050-and-pulse-sensor-with-esp32
This fall-detection device will be useful for elderly people and whenever the fall is detected notification or alert message will be sent to the sekected family memeber.
In this project we have integrated the pulsesensor and esp32 to detect the fall calculating the jerk Values and sending in app notifications via blynk.
